# Ingredients List
*Estimated time: 3-4 hours*

### Goal
Create a client-side app that lists vitamin ingredients with a detail view. You can use React (Gatsby/Next), Ember.js, or any other JS framework you'd like.

### Notes before you start
- The UI/UX is available in this folder for a desktop layout in both Sketch and PDF formats. Don't worry about making it work on mobile, but it should look good responsively.
- You shouldn't need to create any back-end to support this front-end. There is a file with all necessary data, as well as all assets.
- Each level is designed to build on the previous one - it will get harder, don't feel an obligation to complete all levels. Just complete as much as you feel delivers the product you want to ship.
- When you're done, deploy the app to a free provider (Heroku, etc), and share access to your Github repository with username: '@dja'.
- Try not to go over the allotted time :)

#### Level 1
- Create a list of ingredients, with an expanded detail view that shows when clicking an ingredient.

#### Level 2
- Add the ability to cycle through related articles for an ingredient. If there's only 1 article, the carousel should be static with no arrows.
- Bonus: Make it easy to choose whether it can infinitely cycle or not.

#### Level 3
- Add the functionality to **add** or **remove** ingredients from the list. Adding or removing an ingredient should change the ingredient list automatically.

#### Level 4
- Add the ability to search ingredients by name.
- Bonus: Try searching ingredients by more than name?

**Report:**
- Where did you find difficulty in building a solution?
- Which parts were fun and inspirational to you?
- If you had more time, what would you do next?
